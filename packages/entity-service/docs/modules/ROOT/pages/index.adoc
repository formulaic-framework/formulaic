= Entity Service

We've found that every Nest application we've written with TypeORM has a core set of database utility methods
that almost every service uses.

Formulaic ships with a base `EntityService` class to provide all of the helpers you may need.

The `EntityService` returns data structured using the xref:fp::index.adoc[FP] library,
which provides easy utilities to interact with returned data.
