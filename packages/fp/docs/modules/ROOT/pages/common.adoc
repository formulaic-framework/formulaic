= Common FP Instances

FP ships with a set of implementations of the xref:fp.adoc[`FP` interface], each useful for different use cases.

These implementations are organized into a basic hierarchy to help you narrow down which implementation is most suited for your use case.

[#data]
== Data

There are two main interfaces commonly used for representing "successful data" - `DataFP` and `Literal`.

[#literal]
=== Literal

`Literal` has been used extensively in the documentation so far,
and is designed to be a very simple wrapper around values of any type.

.Basic example of `Literal`
[source,typescript]
----
import { Literal } from "@formulaic/fp";

const input = new Literal(10); // => Literal<number>
expect(input.data).toBe(10);
----

`Literal` allows you to create an `FP` object without defining any classes or potential for conflicting fields,
however it means all data is a layer below inside the `data` property.

[#data-fp]
=== DataFP

`DataFP` is an abstract class that is ready for you to define your own `FP` object,
representing a successful state.

The xref:custom.adoc[next section will walk through] extending `DataFP` in depth.

By extending `DataFP`, details are available at the top level, and can also be included in OpenAPI documents.

.Example usage of custom class extending `DataFP`
[source,typescript]
----
const response = new LoginResponse("admin", "[jwt contents]"); // <.>
expect(response.id).toBe("admin");
----
<.> `LoginResponse` extends `DataFP`, and is defined in the xref:custom.adoc[next section].

[#error]
== Errors

FP contains a few ways to represent "errors"footnote:[FP does not assign any specific definition or severity when using the term "error", leaving it to the user.]
or other failures.

[#error-unexpected]
=== UnexpectedError

We mention `UnexpectedError` first, which may be the only error implementation you wish to use
if you are concerned about revealing information in the case of failures.

.Interface of `UnexpectedError`
[source,typescript]
----
class UnexpectedError<T, Err = any> extends ErrorFP<T> {
  kind: "UnexpectedError";
  status: 500;
  code?: string;
  error?: Err;
  serializedError?: string;
}
----

If you use {fp-interceptor}, `UnexpectedError` defaults to only returning
`kind` and `status` in production environments,
while also including `code` and `error` in development.

This allows you to safely create instances and sub-classes of `UnexpectedError`
without any risk of revealing error causes or information in production,
which may reveal sensitive information.

[#error-fp]
=== ErrorFP

If you wish to create your own errors (that aren't set to hide all properties by default),
`ErrorFP` is made to be extended.

[TIP]
====
`ErrorFP` extends `Error` with only one change - `ErrorFP` sets `noValue` to `true`, which prevents substitutions from running.

This is very often the desired behavior, however in some cases may have something that "failed" yet still should be treated as a missing value.

For these cases you can extend `Error` instead of `ErrorFP`, and the same instructions will hold.
====

[#no-value]
== No Value

FP defines an explicit "empty" or "missing value" type, which both avoids the dangers of "null"
and enables chaining and other utility functions.

FP provides three ways to create "no value" responses.

[#no-value-empty]
=== Empty

Earlier sections have already used the `Empty` class as a counterpart to `Literal`
xref:data.adoc[in order to create Either-like functionality].

`Empty` is often used as-is to create a `null`-like "valueless-value",
or can be extended.

[#no-value-built-in]
=== Other built-in implementations

Along with the minimal `Empty` class, FP also includes built-in implementations
like `MissingPermission`.

[#no-value-custom]
=== Custom Implementation of NoValue

`NoValue` can be directly extended for your own purposes.

[#no-value-not-found]
=== NotFound

Frequently applications need to handle requests for entities that users do not have
permission to view.

While a permission denied request could be sent as a 401 Unauthorized response,
it is often good practice to respond with a 404 Not Found response,
completely obscuring all information about the entity including it's existence.

However, during development and debugging, there normally is no reason why developers
should be restricted from seeing the root cause of an error.

FP provides a built-in type to handle this specific case due to how often it comes up,
even in other FP modules like our xref:entity-service::index.adoc[database utilities].

**NotFound** is a base class like <<error-unexpected>>, where all information is stripped
by default in production.

`NotFound` can be used directly, taking a description of the entity, and a flag `permissionError`
which is set to `true` if an entity exists but the user can't access it,
and set to `false` if the entity does not exist.

[source,typescript]
----
const notFound = new NotFound("User", false);
const notPermitted = new NotFound<User, User>("User", true);
----

A shortcut, `AccessForbidden` exists for permission errors:

[source,typescript]
----
const forbidden = new AccessForbidden<User, User>("User");
----

And implementations like `EntityNotFound` exist for failed operations,
and may include additional information (like the failed query):

[source,typescript]
----
import { Literal, EntityNotFound } from "@formulaic/fp";
import { Repository, FindOneOptions } from "typeorm";

async function findById(
  repo: Repository<User>,
  id: string,
): Promise<Literal<User> | EntityNotFound<User, User, "User", FindOneOptions>> {
  const query: FindOneOptions = {
    where: { id },
  };
  const found = await repo.findOne(query);
  if(!found) {
    return new EntityNotFound("User", query);
  }
  return new Literal(found);
}
----
