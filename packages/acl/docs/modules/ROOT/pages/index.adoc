= Authorization (ACL)

Many components of Formulaic have been built with claim/subject-based authorization in mind.

We recommend and have the best integration with the {casl} library for defining and querying permissions,
although almost all of our components can work with other systems as well.

This section will walk through setting up an authorization library using {casl} and Formulaic's ACL utilities.
