= Define ACL Subjects

You'll want to describe the objects that you'll write permission rules about,
including the description of users.

Formulaic follows a pattern where each subject is prefixed with "ACL", which makes it clear
that objects are ACL interfaces.

import { AclUser as BaseAclUser } from "@formulaic/acl";
import { Role } from "./role";

export enum Subject {
  AclPost = "AclPost",
  AclUser = "AclUser",
}

export class AclUser extends BaseAclUser<Role> {
}

export class AclPost {
  public readonly kind: Subject.AclPost;
  public readonly id: string;
  public readonly published: boolean;
  public readonly authorId: string;
}
