= Define User Roles

Many features of Formulaic are setup for users to have one or more roles
assigned to their account.

To take account of these features, create an enum of all roles.

.`src/role.ts`
[source,typescript]
----
export enum Role {
  ADMIN = "admin",
  EDITOR = "editor",
  WRITER = "writer",
  USER = "user",
}
