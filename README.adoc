= formulaic: CodeLenny's Kitchen Sink Framework
:nest: https://nestjs.com/[NestJS]
:react: https://reactjs.org/[React]

Formulaic is a collection of {nest} modules and {react} elements
for building web applications, aimed to provide common functionalities and utilities.

You do not need to integrate this entire framework in your project -
similar to the Nest framework, we allow you to include the features you would like,
and you retain the ability to configure and customize each piece.
