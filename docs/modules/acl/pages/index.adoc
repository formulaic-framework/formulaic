Some of Formulaic's modules provide integration with authorization systems.

Our core modules (such as xref:auth:index.adoc[]) are relatively framework agnostic,
but our more higher-level modules are opinionated and require {casl}.

The following pages will walk through setting up a {casl}-based authorization system
that will nicely integrate with Formulaic.
