= Define Roles

Many components of Formulaic support the notion of user roles,
although most do not require you to use roles if you don't wish to.

We'd recommend creating an enum of roles:

.`src/role.ts` in ACL package
[source,ts]
----
export enum Role {
  ADMIN = "admin",
  EDITOR = "editor",
  MODERATOR = "moderator",
  USER = "user",
}
----
