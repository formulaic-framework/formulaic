= Reading the Documentation

There are a lot of features and components in Formulaic, which leads to a long list of documentation sections.

If you are looking for a specific feature or functionality, scan the sidebar for the topic you are interested in.

Otherwise, the documentation generally ranges from lighter-weight utilities on the top, to larger modules at the bottom.
Scanning through each section in order is a good approach to seeing what Formulaic offers.
